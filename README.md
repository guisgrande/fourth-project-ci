#### Agile

For the development of this project, the Agile methodology was applied. As a support tool, I used the GitHub projects.

- To visualize the project access this link > [Agile Auto Classic](https://github.com/guisgrande/fourth-project-ci/projects/1)

As you can see, we used a simple Kanban board with the fields (To do, Doing, Done). To do the next ones that will be executed, Doing the ones that are currently being developed and Done the ones that were finished.

The final structure after the elaboration was 5 different epics and a total of 26 User Stories distributed among them. In the following image, I detail the EPICs and their respective US.

To run agile most efficiently, the following Sprints were determined as per the following image. The User Stories __#08 Recovery password__ and __#09 Edit username__ were not implemented in the project at this moment, being on stand by for future updates.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the content of the website, so I can know if it's of my interest.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can load the page with the content I want to access.
- As a user, I want to have access to all the links, so I can connect to the website's social networks.
- As a user, I want to create an account and login/logout, so I can interact with the website and community, access my account and close it on multiple devices.
- As a user, I want to add new posts, edit and delete them, so I can upload my content and manipulate it if necessary.
- As a user, I want to interact with the other posts, so I can give my opinion and interact with my favorites.

### Scope

For the scope of this project the following key points were determined.
- Create a webpage application using the Django framework.
- Use bootstrap to make the site responsive, and custom CSS and Java Script to complement.
- Allow the user to create an account in order to upload content.
- Allow logged in users to interact with other posts through comments and actions.
- Allow users to manipulate their content (CRUD Operations).
- The frontend should be simple and present the content in a clear way.
- The website should be functional, easy to navigate and intuitive.

### Structure

Auto Classic, will have five distinct pages for the first-time user.
- Home page, Garage (Cars), Events, Signup, and Signin.

Unlogged users will be able to navigate through these five pages and will be able to see the details of each Car or Event by clicking on its link. But they will not be able to interact.

When the user creates an account and is logged in, the following pages will be displayed.
- Home page, Garage (Cars), Events, Logout, Members.

Logged-in users will be able to access the site completely. Being able to access the details of the cars and events post and interact with them.

He will be able to access his area (Members) to add new posts, modify the ones already added, or delete them.
